To predict stock values based on news articles and their publication dates, you can use a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Here are some models and approaches that can be effective:

### 1. **BERT-based Models**
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful NLP model that can be fine-tuned for various text analysis tasks. You can use a BERT-based model to extract contextualized embeddings from news articles and then use these embeddings as features for stock prediction.

### 2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
RNNs, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are well-suited for time series data. You can use LSTMs to capture temporal dependencies in stock prices and combine them with the textual features extracted from news articles.

### 3. **Transformer-based Models**
Transformer models, such as the one used in the [Stanford CS224N project](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/final-reports/256844806.pdf), can integrate technical stock data with financial news analysis. These models can process the full content of news articles and corresponding stock market metrics to predict stock trends.

### 4. **Multimodal Deep Fusion Models**
A multimodal deep fusion model combines multiple data sources, such as daily stock prices, technical indicators, and sentiment in daily news headlines. This approach leverages a BERT-based model for news analysis and an LSTM branch for capturing temporal patterns in stock prices.

### Example Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Collect news articles and stock prices. Preprocess the text data (tokenization, removing stop words, etc.).
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use a BERT-based model to extract embeddings from news articles.
3. **Model Training**: Combine the extracted embeddings with stock price data and train a model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to predict stock values.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

### Example Code
Here's a simplified example of how you might set up such a model using Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load and preprocess data
news_data = pd.read_csv('news_articles.csv')
stock_data = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')

# Extract features using BERT
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

def extract_features(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, padding=True)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).detach().numpy()

news_data['features'] = news_data['article_text'].apply(extract_features)

# Combine news features with stock data
combined_data = pd.merge(news_data, stock_data, on='date')
X = np.vstack(combined_data['features'].values)
y = combined_data['stock_price'].values

# Train a regression model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
mse = np.mean((y_pred - y_test) ** 2)
r2 = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)

print(f'MSE: {mse}, R²: {r2}')
```

This example demonstrates how to extract features from news articles using BERT and combine them with stock price data to train a regression model. You can further enhance this approach by using more sophisticated models and techniques.
